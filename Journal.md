# Operators

Arithmetic Operations:
-
Simple Maths within programming.

Example Variables: var a = 3; var b = 6;

1. (+) - add (addition) Example: a + b = 9
2. (-) - Subtract (Subtraction) Example: b - a = 3
3. (*) - Multiply Example: a * b = 18
4. (/) - Divide Example: b / a = 2
5. (%) - Modulus Example: a + b = 9
6. (++) - Increment by one Example: a++ (this will become 4)
7. (--) - Decrement by one Example: b- (this will become 5)

Relational Operations:
-
Relational Operators are used when we compare 2 values. These are used when using if statement and loops comparisons always give us a true false value.

8. (==) - Check if 2 values are equal Example: a + b = 9
9. (!=) - Check if 2 values are not equal Example: b - a = 3
10. (<) - Smaller than Example: a < b = true
11. (>) - greater than Example: b > a = True
12. (>=) Check if the left side is greater or equal to the right side. Example: a + b = 9
13. (<=) Check if the left side is smaller or equal to the right side Example: a++ (this will be 4).

Logical Operators:
-
Logical Operators compares 2 or more boolean values
Each Relational Operator gives a boolean value
These are also used with if statements

For the examples below assume that a = true and b = false

14. (&&) And operator-both sides have to be true. Example: (a && b) this will be false
15. (||) Or operator - Only one side needs to be true. Example: (a || b) This would be true
16. (!) Or operator - Only one side needs to be true. Example: !(a && b) this would be true.

Assignment Operators:
-
Assignment Operators sets a value to a variable
a single = is an assignment (not equals like in maths)

Assume that a = 3 and b = 6 and c = 5 as values. d will hold an answer

17. (=) Assignment Example: d = a + b (answer (d) is 9)
18. (+=) AND AND adds a value to the left operand in the equation on the right. Example: c += a; c = c + a (c = 8)
19. (-=) SUBTRACTS and removes a value from the left operand in the equation on the right Example: c -= a; c = c - a (c = 2)
20. (*=) MULTIPLIES and gets the product of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: c *= b; c = c * b (c = 2)
21. (/=) DIVIDES and gets the division of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: b /= 3; b = b /3 (b = 2)
22. (%=) MODULUS and gets the modulus of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: c %= a; c = c % a (c = 2)
---
# Variables
A variable is a name for a value, so that we can reference to a word rather than a value

C# Variable:
---
```C#
var name = "Dayne";
```
JavaScript Variable:
---
```js
var name = "Dayne"
```
---
# User Input

C# Example:
-
```c#
var userInput = Console.ReadLine();
```
JavaScript Example:
-
```JS
var person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
```

# Constants
A constant works the same way as a variable. But a constant value can't be changed.

C# Constant:
---
```C#
const string a = "This is the value";
```
JavaScript constant:
---
```js
const a = "This is the value"
```
---
# Let (JavaScript Only)
A let is only used by JavaScript. Let is like a variable but is used inside of a block such as a if and else statement and can only be used in that block. But you can create another let with the same name and value in another block.

```js
let a = 10;
```
---
# Text Representation
Text representation is just displaying text to the user.

C# Example:
---
```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```
JavaScript Example:
---
```js
console.log("Hello World");
```
---
# Boolean 
A boolean holds a value of true or false. A boolean in javascript can be a var or let.

C# Example (using a do loop example):
-
```C#
bool keepgoing = true;

do
{
    Console.WriteLine("I am going to get a drink soon!");
    Console.WriteLine("Do you want to keep going? y/n");
    string response = Console.ReadLine();

    if (response == "n")
        keepgoing = false;
}
while (keepgoing == true);

Console.ReadLine();
```


# If and Else Statements
An if statement (also known as an if else statement) is a statement that identifies what statement to run based on the value of a Boolean expression. If the Boolean statement is true it will run through the if statement and if the statement is false it will run through the else statement.


C# Example:
---
```C#
if ("10" == "10")
{
    <-- Execute if it is true
}
else
{
    <-- Execute if it is False
}
```
With JavaScript there are two different types. The first one is if you use == (2 equals) it will only check the value together. But if you use (3 equals) === it checks the value and the type e.g. variable, interger etc.

JavaScript Example 1 (2 equals):
---
```js
if ("20" == 20)
{
    //Execute the true block  
}
else {
    //Execute the else block
}
```
This statement is true because the values are both the same and doesn't check the type.

JavaScript Example 2 (3 equals):
---
```js
if ("20" === 20)
{
    //Execute the true block  
}
else {
    //Execute the else block
}
```
This is going to be false because it is checking the value and the type and the type isn't the same.

---

# Loops (C# and JavaScript)

For Loop:
-
Well by using a for loop you can run a statement (you donâ€™t have to use just one statement you can use as many statements as you want). A for loop will run repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates to false.

C# Example:
-
```c#
var counter = 12;
var tables = 1;


for (var i = 0; i < counter; i++)
{
var a = i + 1;
Console.WriteLine($"{a} x {tables} = {a * tables}");
}
/* Output:
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 1 = 2
3 x 1 = 3
4 x 1 = 4
5 x 1 = 5
6 x 1 = 6
7 x 1 = 7
8 x 1 = 8
9 x 1 = 9
10 x 1 = 10
11 x 1 = 11
12 x 1 = 12
*/
```

JavaScript Example:
-
```JS
let count = 12;
let tables = 5;

for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {

    let a = i + 1;
    console.log(a + "x" + tables + "=" + (a * tables));

}
/* Output:
1x5=5
2x5=10
3x5=15
4x5=20
5x5=25
6x5=30
7x5=35
8x5=40
9x5=45
10x5=50
11x5=55
12x5=60
*/
```

Do Loop
-
A do loop is a loop that will go on repeatedly until the user (you) closes the loop or the loop finds false then stops. Does check condition before entering, runs at least once.

C# Example:
```c#
bool keepgoing = true;

do
{
    Console.WriteLine("I am going to get a drink soon!");
    Console.WriteLine("Do you want to keep going?y/n");
    string response = Console.ReadLine();
    if (response == "n")
    {
        keepgoing = false;
    }
}
while (keepgoing == true);
{
    Console.Readline();
}
```

JavaScript Example:
-
```js
var drink = function() { // Write your do/while loop here! 
    var choice = "y";
    do {

        choice = prompt("I am going to get a drink soon! Do you want me to keep going? y/n");

    } while (choice != "n");
};
drink()
```

While Loop
-
A while loop is a control flow statement that goes on repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The loop can also be known as a repeating if statement.

C# Example:
-
```C#
while (count < 3)
{
    Random rnd = new Random();
    int result = rnd.Next(0,2);

    if (result == 1)//if the result is 1 it will show tails
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Tails");
        count = count + 1;
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Heads");
        count = count + 1;
    }

    Console.ReadLine();
}
```

JavaScript Example:
-
```js
let counter = 5;
let index = 0;

while(index < counter) {

    let a = index + 1;
    console.log("This is line number " + a);

    index++
}
```
---
# NaN as a result of a loop:
NaN stands for not a number:

```js
var multiples = [1064, 256, 374, 102, "sheep", "camel"];
var newArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < multiples.length; i++) {
//checking if it is a number
 if (!isNaN(multiples[i])) 
  {  
     console.log(multiples[i])  //showing us the number
     newArray[i] = multiples[i] //add numbers to a new array
  }
}
console.log("Only Numbers - ", newArray)
```
---
#  JavaScript Array 
Arrays work also very similar in Javascript, but there are no lists.

Create a new array:
-
```js
var multiples = [1064, 256, 374, 102, "sheep", "camel"];
```
The VIP Reference:
-
```js
var multiples = [1064, 256, 374, 102, "sheep", "camel"]; [v] (value)
index =            0    1    2    3      4        5      [i] (index)
position =       1st   2nd  3rd  4th    5th      6th     [p] (position)
```
Some extra JavaScript Methods:
-
```js
var multiples = [1064, 256, 374, 102, "sheep", "camel"];
var firstItem = multiples[0];     //1064
var length = multiples.length     //6
var allItems = multiples.join()   //"1064,256,374,102,sheep,camel"
var sorting = multiples.sort()    //102, 1064, 256, 374, "camel", "sheep"
var reverse = multiples.reverse() //"camel", "sheep", 102, 374, 256, 1064
```
Adding Items into an Array:
-
Adding to the end of the Array:
-
```js
var newLength = multiples.push('horse');
// [1064, 256, 374, 102, "sheep", "camel", "horse"]
```
Removing the last item of the array:
-
```js
var last = multiples.pop(); // remove "camel" (from the end)
```
Finding a position of an item in an array:
-
```js
var pos = multiples.indexOf('camel'); //5
```
---
# C# Arrays and Lists
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Create an Array
    var a = new string[6] {"Apples", "Cherry", "Bannana", "Tomato", "Oranges", "Mandarin"};

    //Sort the Array in Alphabetical Order
    Array.Sort(a);

    //Print the Array to the screen
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", a));

    //Output
    //Apples, Banana, Cherry, Mandarin, Oranges, Tomato
}
```
Arrays can also be displayed backwards:
-
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Create an Array
    var a = new string[6] {"Apples", "Cherry", "Bannana", "Tomato", "Oranges", "Mandarin"};

    //Sort the Array in Alphabetical Order
    Array.Reverse(a);

    //Print the Array to the screen
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", a));

    //Output
    //Mandarin, Oranges, Tomato, Banana, Cherry, Apples
}
```
Just change Array.Sort(a); to Array.Reverse(a);

Sorting in reverse (Alphabetical)
-
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Create an Array
    var a = new string[6] {"Apples", "Cherry", "Bannana", "Tomato", "Oranges", "Mandarin"};

    //Sort the Array in Alphabetical Order
    Array.Sort(a);
    Array.Reverse(a);

    //Print the Array to the screen
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", a));

    //Output
    //Tomato, Oranges, Mandarin, Cherry, Banana, Apples
}
```
Array values can be printed in a loop or using string methods
-
```C#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Create an Array
    var a = new string[6] {"Apples", "Cherry", "Bannana", "Tomato", "Oranges", "Mandarin"};
    
    //Print the Array as a string
    var output = string.Join(",", a);

    //Print the Array to the screen
    Console.WriteLine(output);

    //Output
    //"Apples, Cherry, Banana, Tomato, Oranges, Mandarin"
}
```
Array Values can be printed in a loop or using string methods
```C#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //Create an Array
    var a = "Apples are green and taste good";
    
    //Print the Array as a string
    var output = a.Split(' ');//Needs to be ' ' not " "

    //Print the Array to the screen
    Console.WriteLine(output[2]);

    //Output
    //"green"
}
```
To define an array we use the keyword var.

1. Arrays hold multiple values inside a single variable
2. Values can be sorted using Array.Sort(array name)

Lists
-
List<T> are a very similar to arrays in terms of functionality

Reference is the same, but List<T> offer more options

Not having to set a length when defining them allows for adding and removing object later in the program.
```C#
var names = new list<string> {"bob," "Jack", "Salty"};

//Arrays use .Length to display their length
//List <T> uses the .Count to display their length
//Both return a number, just use the right one for the right type.
```
```C#
var names = new list<string> {"bob," "Jack", "Salty"};

//Objects can be added and removed

names.Add("Peter");
names.Remove("bob);
```
```C#
var firstname = "Carol";
var names = new List<string> {"bob," "Jack", "Sally"};

//Objects can be added and removed

names.Add(firstname);
names.Remove(firstname);

names.Remove(names[2]);
```
Lists are single dimension arrays.

Use a Tuple, if you want to take multiple parameters(new since .Net 4.0)
```C#
var names = new List<Tuple<string, int>>();
names.add(Tuple.Create("bob", 32));

names[0].Item1 //"bob"
names[0].Item2 //32
```
# TryParse
Sometimes we need to change the datatype so that we can do other things with our data.
For example when doing number conversion, we cannot do this using strings.

To be able convert strings to a numeric value (int, double, floats) we use the .Parse() method.
If we want to convert a string to a whole number we would use int.Parse(string) and store that value into a variable.

For a conversion to happen successfully the input from the user needs to be a number, or else you will get a value of 0 or a program crash.
```c#
Console.WriteLine("Please enter in a number");
var input1 = Console.ReadLine();
var number1 = int.Parse(input1);

Console.WriteLine(number1 * 2);
```
Using TryParse
-
As the name implies, a tryParse() tries to parse the string. This is a boolean operation, which returns true or false For this we need to setup 2 variables, one that holds a number (int, double, floats) and one that holds the boolean value.

```c#
//Get input from user
Console.WriteLine("Please enter in a number");
var input1 = Console.ReadLine();

//Check if the input from the user is a number
var number1 = 0;
var isNumber = int.TryParse(input1, out number1);

//If the value is a number, go on with the program, or else tell the user they made an error
if(isNumber) {
    Console.WriteLine(number1 * 2);
}
else {
    Console.WriteLine("Please type in a number next time.");
}
```

# JavaScript Parsing

To interact with data using Javascript we use alert, prompt and confirm boxes. This data can then be stored into a variable.

For now we will still show information to the console, but we could display this information in a proper website as well.

To display a message without any input we use an alert box:
```js
alert("I am an alert box!");
```
To deal with a simple choice input from a user we would use a confirm box. Next we would use an if statement to control what the program does next.
```js
var txt; 

if (confirm("Press a button!") == true) {
    txt = "You pressed OK!";
} else {
    txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
}

console.log(txt);
```
Lastly to deal with user input we would use a prompt Here the user is asked a question and that value is stored in a variable.
```js
var txt; 

var person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");

if (person == null || person == "") {
    txt = "User cancelled the prompt.";
} else {
    txt = "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
}

console.log(person);
console.log(txt);
```
Displaying Information Better
-
Javascript relies heavily on the use of functions, so that not everything happens all at once as soon as a page loads.

How functions work will be explained in more detail, for now use the following code to help you out.
```html
<body>
    <button onclick="trythis()">Press me!</button>  <!-- we have a button that calls a function called trythis() -->
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
</body>
```
```js
let trythis = () => {

    /* 
        This is an empty function, whatever code 
        is placed in here is called when the button is clicked.
    */
}
```
Number Conversions
-
Javascript makes use of the functions parseInt(string) and parseFloat(string) to get a number value from a string. The functions can be linked to a variable so that the numbers can be used in calculations etc.
```js
var input1 = "32"; //this is a string
var number1 = parseint(input1); //this is now a number
```
