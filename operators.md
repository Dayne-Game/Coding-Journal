# Operators

Arithmetic Operations:
-
Simple Maths within programming.

Example Variables: var a = 3; var b = 6;

1. (+) - add (addition) Example: a + b = 9
2. (-) - Subtract (Subtraction) Example: b - a = 3
3. (*) - Multiply Example: a * b = 18
4. (/) - Divide Example: b / a = 2
5. (%) - Modulus Example: a + b = 9
6. (++) - Increment by one Example: a++ (this will become 4)
7. (--) - Decrement by one Example: b- (this will become 5)

Relational Operations:
-
Relational Operators are used when we compare 2 values. These are used when using if statement and loops comparisons always give us a true false value.

8. (==) - Check if 2 values are equal Example: a + b = 9
9. (!=) - Check if 2 values are not equal Example: b - a = 3
10. (<) - Smaller than Example: a < b = true
11. (>) - greater than Example: b > a = True
12. (>=) Check if the left side is greater or equal to the right side. Example: a + b = 9
13. (<=) Check if the left side is smaller or equal to the right side Example: a++ (this will be 4).

Logical Operators:
-
Logical Operators compares 2 or more boolean values
Each Relational Operator gives a boolean value
These are also used with if statements

For the examples below assume that a = true and b = false

14. (&&) And operator-both sides have to be true. Example: (a && b) this will be false
15. (||) Or operator - Only one side needs to be true. Example: (a || b) This would be true
16. (!) Or operator - Only one side needs to be true. Example: !(a && b) this would be true.

Assignment Operators:
-
Assignment Operators sets a value to a variable
a single = is an assignment (not equals like in maths)

Assume that a = 3 and b = 6 and c = 5 as values. d will hold an answer

17. (=) Assignment Example: d = a + b (answer (d) is 9)
18. (+=) AND AND adds a value to the left operand in the equation on the right. Example: c += a; c = c + a (c = 8)
19. (-=) SUBTRACTS and removes a value from the left operand in the equation on the right Example: c -= a; c = c - a (c = 2)
20. (*=) MULTIPLIES and gets the product of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: c *= b; c = c * b (c = 2)
21. (/=) DIVIDES and gets the division of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: b /= 3; b = b /3 (b = 2)
22. (%=) MODULUS and gets the modulus of the value on the left and a number on the right. Example: c %= a; c = c % a (c = 2)
